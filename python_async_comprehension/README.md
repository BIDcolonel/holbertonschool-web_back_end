# Python - Async Comprehension

This project focuses on learning how to write an asynchronous generator, use async comprehensions, and type-annotate generators.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to write an asynchronous generator
- Learn how to use async comprehensions
- Gain knowledge on how to type-annotate generators

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code should follow the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- The length of files will be tested using wc
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Documentation should be a complete sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length will be verified)
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
